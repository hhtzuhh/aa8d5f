📚 Prefill Mapping Editor (React Flow + Modals)
🛠 Purpose
We are building a graph-based UI to edit prefill mappings between forms.
Each form node in the graph represents a form (like Form A, Form B, etc.).
Each form has fields (like email, name, dynamic_object, etc.).

The goal is to allow users to:
View a graph showing relationships (dependencies) between forms.
Click on a form node to open details (which fields it has).
For each field, configure a "prefill source" — saying:
“Fill this field using data from an earlier form's field.”
If a field is already prefilling from somewhere, show it and allow removing it.



🔥 Benefits
Helps auto-populate later forms based on earlier forms, so users don't have to type the same data again.
Prepopulated fields make forms faster, smarter, and more accurate.
